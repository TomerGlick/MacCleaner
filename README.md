A powerful, native macOS application to clean up your Mac and free up storage space. Built with SwiftUI and designed with safety and user control in mind.

> ⚠️ **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: This application deletes files from your system. While it includes safety features and protections, always review what will be deleted before confirming. Some files, especially developer tools and simulator runtimes, can be large but may be needed for your work. The developers are not responsible for any data loss or system issues that may occur from using this application.

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements
- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later (for building from source)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MacCleaner.git
cd MacCleaner
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open MacStorageCleanupApp.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run:
   - Select the `MacStorageCleanupApp` scheme
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run

### Download Pre-built Binary

*Check the [Releases](https://github.com/TomerGlick/MacCleaner/releases) page*

## 🔒 Permissions

The app requires the following permissions to function properly:

- **Full Disk Access** - Required to scan and clean cache directories
  - Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access
  - Add Mac Storage Cleanup to the list
  - The app will prompt you on first launch if this permission is not granted

## ⚠️ Important Safety Information

**Please read carefully before using this application:**

### Risky Deletions

Some files that can be cleaned are **critical for certain workflows**:

- **Xcode Simulator Runtimes** - Deleting these will remove iOS/iPadOS simulators. You'll need to re-download them (several GB each) if you need them for development.
- **Xcode DerivedData** - Safe to delete but will cause longer build times on next Xcode build.
- **Developer Tool Caches** - May require re-downloading dependencies (npm, CocoaPods, etc.)
- **Browser Caches** - Will log you out of websites and require re-downloading cached content.

### Best Practices

1. **Use Debug Mode First** - Test what will be deleted without actually deleting
2. **Review Before Deleting** - Always check the preview before confirming
3. **Start Small** - Clean obvious caches first (browser, system caches)
4. **Backup Important Data** - Enable backup option for critical cleanups
5. **Know What You're Deleting** - Hover over items to see full paths and descriptions

### What's Protected

The app automatically protects:
- System files required for macOS to function
- User data (Photos, Mail, Messages, Contacts, etc.)
- Active applications
- Keychains and security files

### Disclaimer

This software is provided "as is" without warranty. The developers are not responsible for:
- Data loss from deleted files
- System instability
- Broken development environments
- Lost work or productivity

**Always maintain regular backups of your important data.**

## 💡 Usage
